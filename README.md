üöÄ About This Project

This repository contains the complete public-facing booking website for the "IGNITE 2025" event. It's a single-page application (SPA) designed to be the "front door" for attendees. It handles everything from event information and AI-powered support to secure ticket purchasing and instant ticket delivery.

It is built with Vanilla JavaScript and Tailwind CSS for a fast, modern, and fully responsive experience, with no frontend framework dependencies. This project serves as the client-facing component of a larger event management system that includes a secure admin panel and QR code verifier (in separate repositories/projects).

‚ú® Key Features

Secure Payment Integration: Built with Razorpay Checkout for a seamless, secure, and mobile-friendly payment process.

AI Support Chatbot: Features "Dolly," a custom-branded AI assistant powered by the Google Gemini API. It's pre-programmed with all event details (menu, rules, venue) to answer attendee questions in a friendly, conversational style.

Instant Ticket Generation: On successful payment, the app instantly generates a downloadable Ticket and Payment Receipt.

Uses qrious to create a unique, scannable QR code for the ticket.

Uses html2canvas and jsPDF to offer downloads in both JPG and combined PDF formats.

Secure Backend Connection: Securely submits all registration data to a Cloud Firestore database, placing it in a pending_registrations collection for admin approval (handled by a separate, secure admin application). Uses Firebase Anonymous Authentication for secure write access.

Fully Responsive Design: A mobile-first design built with Tailwind CSS that looks great on all devices, from phones to desktops.

Dynamic UI: Includes custom animations, a mobile-friendly navbar, and interactive menu cards using only Vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

<details><summary>This project utilizes the following technologies and services:</summary>

HTML5: Standard markup language for creating web pages.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

JavaScript (ES6+): Core programming language for web interactivity. Uses modern features like Modules.

Firebase Firestore: A flexible, scalable NoSQL cloud database to store registration data securely.

Firebase Authentication: Used for Anonymous Authentication to secure database writes.

Razorpay API: Payment gateway integration for secure online payments in India.

Google Gemini API: Powers the "Dolly" AI assistant for answering user questions.

jsPDF: Client-side JavaScript library to generate PDF documents.

html2canvas: JavaScript library to take "screenshots" of HTML elements.

qrious: JavaScript library for generating QR codes.

</details>



üîÑ How It Works: Data Flow

A user visits the site, which anonymously authenticates with Firebase in the background.

The user fills out the registration form (name, email, mobile).

The app initiates the Razorpay payment modal with the event amount.

The user completes the payment on Razorpay's secure gateway.

On successful payment, Razorpay returns a paymentId.

The app combines the form data and paymentId and securely writes it as a new document to the pending_registrations collection in Firestore. This write is allowed by the FIRESTORE.rules.

Simultaneously, the app uses the user's data to generate the ticket and receipt on-the-fly and presents them with download buttons.

(Separately) An admin uses a secure admin panel (not included in this repo) to read from pending_registrations, approve the ticket (which moves it to an approved_registrations collection), and prepare it for verification at the event using a QR scanner app (also separate).

üß∞ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

üìã Prerequisites

You will need accounts and API keys for the following services:

Firebase (for Firestore & Auth)

Razorpay (for payment keys - use Test keys for development)

Google AI Studio (for the Gemini API Key)

Node.js (Optional: for using a local development server like live-server)

Git

‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/suyogsontakke/ignite-2025-website.git
```
```bash
cd ignite-2025-website
```


Set Up Firebase

Create a new project in the Firebase Console.

Go to Firestore Database, create a database (start in Test mode for easy setup, but remember to secure it with rules later).

Go to the Rules tab, paste the contents of the FIRESTORE.rules file from this repository and Publish.

Go to Authentication -> Sign-in method and enable Anonymous sign-in.

Go to Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è icon) -> Your apps -> Web app. Register a new web app, and copy the Firebase config object (it looks like { apiKey: "...", authDomain: "...", ... }).

Configure Environment Variables (in index.html)

Open index.html in a code editor.

Find the <script type="module"> section.

Firebase Config: Locate the firebaseConfig object and paste your copied config values there.

Gemini API Key: Find the getDollyResponse function. Replace the placeholder apiKey ("YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE" or similar) with your actual Google AI Studio key.

const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"; // <-- PASTE YOUR KEY HERE


Razorpay Key: Find the handlePaymentAndRegistration function. Locate the options object for new Razorpay(options) and replace the placeholder key with your Razorpay Test Key.

const options = {
    "key": "YOUR_RAZORPAY_TEST_KEY_HERE", // <-- PASTE YOUR KEY HERE
    // ... other options
};


‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run Locally

Simple Method: Open the index.html file directly in your web browser.

Recommended Method (using a local server):

If you don't have a local server installed, you can use npx:

npx live-server


Or, if you have Node.js installed, you can install live-server globally:

npm install -g live-server
live-server


This will typically open the site at http://127.0.0.1:8080 (or similar) and automatically reload when you save changes. Using a server avoids potential issues with ES6 modules loading directly from the file system.

üîí Environment Variables

This project requires the following keys/credentials to be configured directly within the index.html file:

// Inside <script type="module">

// Firebase Configuration Object
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID"
};

// Google Gemini API Key (inside getDollyResponse function)
const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE";

// Razorpay Key ID (inside handlePaymentAndRegistration function options)
const options = {
    "key": "YOUR_RAZORPAY_TEST_KEY_HERE",
    // ...
};


Note: For a production deployment, consider securing these keys further, potentially using Firebase Hosting's reserved URLs or server-side functions if scaling the project.

üöÄ Deployment

This project is a static website and can be deployed easily to various platforms:

Vercel: Connect your GitHub repository for automatic deployments on push. No special configuration is needed.

Netlify: Similar to Vercel, connect your GitHub repository.

Firebase Hosting: Use the Firebase CLI to deploy the index.html file and any assets.

# Install Firebase CLI (if you haven't already)
npm install -g firebase-tools
# Login to Firebase
firebase login
# Initialize Firebase Hosting in your project folder
firebase init hosting
# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting


GitHub Pages: Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings.

Remember to update the Firebase, Gemini, and Razorpay keys in your deployed index.html file, potentially using Live keys for Razorpay in production.
